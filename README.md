My name is Shri Kolanukuduru. I'm a Venture Investor @ [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app). In the past, I was on the founding team at [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs), a YC-backed startup that optimized recruiting for job-seekers. Before I dropped out to work on Simplify, I studied Applied Math and Public Policy at UNC Chapel-Hill. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:hello@shriyansh.me).
